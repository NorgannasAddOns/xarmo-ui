# xarmo-ui

This is the Xarmo white-label user interface that Xarmo publishers can install and modify for self-hosted or partially self-hosted customers.

The publisher will typically configure, compile and depluy this white-label website as per their branding and marketing requirements for their affiliates to use to manage their affiliate account with the publisher.

This typically involves real-time viewing of their statistics, setting their payment methods, viewing payments, retrieving assets, updating tax details, etc.
  
This user interface also has an admin interface for publishers to manage their affiliate program, make payments, view statistics, edit publishers, upload assets, etc.

Xarmo is an advanced real-time affiliate program offered as SaaS, partially SaaS, and completely self-hosted solutions.
